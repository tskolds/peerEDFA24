### Analysis of reflection responses from FA24 cycling peer-ed session.

As peer education officer of the CSU club cycling team, I am required to organize one peer education
presentation per semester. For the Fall 2024 semester, we held a nutrition talk with a professional
nutritionist/former pro cyclist. I asked attendees to respond to a reflection form as required by sport clubs.

This analysis is a simple overview of the most-used words in refleection responses, with the intention of
discovering the most effective portions of the presentation and the most valuable insights attendees came
away with.
